# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 16, 2026**

This privacy policy applies to the SessionTracker app (hereby referred to as "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Jeffrey Ellin (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Freemium service. This service is intended for use "AS IS".

## Information Collection and Use

The Application collects information when you download and use it. This information may include:

- Your device's Internet Protocol address (e.g. IP address)
- The pages of the Application that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages
- The time spent on the Application
- The operating system you use on your mobile device

### Location Data

The Application collects your device's location, which helps the Service Provider determine your approximate geographical location and make use of in the following ways:

- **Geolocation Services**: The Service Provider utilizes location data to provide features such as personalized content, relevant recommendations, and location-based services.
- **Analytics and Improvements**: Aggregated and anonymized location data helps the Service Provider to analyze user behavior, identify trends, and improve the overall performance and functionality of the Application.
- **Third-Party Services**: Periodically, the Service Provider may transmit anonymized location data to external services. These services assist them in enhancing the Application and optimizing their offerings.

### Personal Information

For a better experience, while using the Application, the Service Provider may require you to provide certain personally identifiable information. The information that the Service Provider requests will be retained by them and used as described in this privacy policy.

The Service Provider may use the information you provided to contact you from time to time to provide you with important information, required notices, and marketing promotions.

### Data Storage

- **Local Storage**: Session data you enter (locations, amounts, notes, etc.) is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.
- **iCloud Sync**: If enabled, your data syncs across your devices using your personal iCloud account. This data is encrypted and managed by Apple according to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Third Party Access

Only aggregated, anonymized data is periodically transmitted to external services to aid the Service Provider in improving the Application and their service. The Service Provider may share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.

The Service Provider may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:

- As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;
- When they believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect their rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;
- With their trusted service providers who work on their behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.

## Opt-Out Rights

You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application marketplace or network.

## Data Retention Policy

The Service Provider will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. If you'd like them to delete User Provided Data that you have provided via the Application, please contact them via the [Support Page](support) and they will respond in a reasonable time.

### Your Data Rights

You have control over your data:

- **Access**: All your data is visible within the Application
- **Export**: You can export your sessions to CSV at any time
- **Deletion**: You can delete individual sessions or all data within the Application

## Children

The Service Provider does not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13.

The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission.

If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider via the [Support Page](support) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.

You must also be at least 16 years of age to consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do so on your behalf).

## In-App Purchases and Subscriptions

The Application offers an optional premium subscription ("SessionTracker Premium") that unlocks additional features. When you make an in-app purchase or subscribe:

- **Payment Processing**: All payments are processed by Apple through your iTunes/App Store account. The Service Provider does not collect, store, or have access to your payment information (credit card numbers, billing address, etc.).
- **Subscription Status**: The Application checks your subscription status locally on your device to determine which features to enable. This status information is not transmitted to the Service Provider.
- **Purchase History**: Records of your purchases are managed by Apple and subject to [Apple's Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/privacy/).

## Security

The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information the Service Provider processes and maintains.

## Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The Service Provider will notify you of any changes to the Privacy Policy by updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.

## Your Consent

By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us.
